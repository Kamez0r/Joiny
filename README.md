### An attempt to get a job :-)
Welcome to my demo project applying for a job at 
<a href="https://soleadify.notion.site/Deeptech-Engineer-Intern-Challenges-b5d4791a26e94979a6abccb62209cf14">Veridion</a>.
My choice for today is the 3rd challenge: <b>Datasets join</b>
___
<b>Challenge #3</b><br>
<b>Datasets join</b>

The input for this challenge is an archive 
(download [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jF7lnMUffCX8U252MoY7jowb7VedFOp8/view?usp=sharing)) 
containing 3 datasets with data about the same companies from 3 different sources: 
1. **Facebook** (facebook dataset.csv)
2. **Google** (google dataset.csv)
3. **Company Website** (website dataset.csv)

The final purpose of this exercise is to create a 4th dataset that contains the other 
3 and, by joining them, we should reach a better accuracy on common columns.

The columns that interest us the most are Category, Address (country, region...), Phone, Company names.
